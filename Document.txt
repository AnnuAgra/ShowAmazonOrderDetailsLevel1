Assignment Title:


Solution:
---------

In this project, I have created two files i.e
1) AmazonOrderDetails.html
2) HTMLIntegratedJson.js

AmazonOrderDetails.html has three options corresponding to three assignment questions:
1. Button to get all Amazon order details
2. A text field to take input of specific order id, which acts as index and data from Order JSON is fetched
3. A text field to take email id of customer, which is searched from Order JSON to fetch orders placed by the customer


About JSON file:
----------------
In JSON file (amazonProductData), I have:

Order details (array of JSON objects, each object indicating an order):
    Order Id, Placed date, Tracking Id, Delivery executives, delivery executive phone number, Warehouse address, Total price, Payment mode
Customer details (who placed the order):
    Customer Id, Name, Address, Delivery Preference, Prime Status, Email, Phone number
Product details (an Array of JSON objects):
    Product Id, Product name, Price, Quantity ordered, weight, Product color
Seller details associated with product sold for the order:
    Seller Id, name, Address and seller rating


Processing JSON:
----------------

I have defined three funcitions in .JS file corresponding to each question in assignment.

1. getAllOrders(), reads the JSON data based on index and show as a output.
2. (getOrderDetailsBasedOnOrderID()), takes the orderId as input and shows output based on the orderId.
3. (getOrderBasedOnEmailID()), takes emailId as input and checks the emailId is present in which index and then shows order details based on index.

Besides, I have also defined a common function with the name(printOrderDetailsByIndex()) that parses JSON order object and creates HTML ouput.
It takes order index as a parameter and based on this index it traverse the output.

try catch
-----------
IF the order Id and emailId doesn't match, it will handle exception and give message that order Id and email Id does not match.
